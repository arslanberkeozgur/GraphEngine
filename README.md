# Graph Engine

This is a minimalistic C++ graph visualization and simulation engine built using SFML. The engine is designed to generate, display, and analyze graphs while allowing basic interactions. The focus is on simplicity, direct access to data structures, and intuitive visual representation.

## Manual Usage

The engine provides interactive controls for manipulating and inspecting graph structures. The following inputs are available:

### Mouse Controls

- **Left Click & Drag:** Move a node.
- **Right Click & Drag:** Pan the view.
- **Scroll Wheel:** Zoom in and out.
- **Hover Over Node:** Display node information.

### Keyboard Controls

- **P:** Pause/unpause simulation.
- **ESC:** Exit the application.
- **Arrow Keys:** Navigate the view.
- **R:** Reset the simulation.
- **+/-:** Increase or decrease simulation speed.

These controls allow users to explore graphs dynamically, observing their structures and properties in real time.
